Developer Info
--------------

### Theme Edits

[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) files are included to compile and minify the CSS and JavaScript.

Edits can be done directly to the non-minified versions and then minified using any other tool.

### Theme Updates

If there are templates and functions in the Twenty Seventeen parent theme that have the same name, the files in this theme override them.

Some files may need to be updated to support new features or fixes in Twenty Seventeen beyond v2.1.


### SVG Icons & Images

This theme uses a customized version of the ``twentyseventeen_get_svg`` function in its inc/icon-functions folder, which overrides the file/function in the parent theme.

SVGs are all separate symbols in assets/images/ufl.svg. All new SVG icons should be displayed in pages using the twentyseventeen_get_svg() function for consistency.

#### Fallback images
If a fallback png is needed for older browsers, it should be defined in the symbol using the ``<image>`` tag workaround. Note: this is not valid HTML markup. See [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to SVG Fallbacks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks/).

#### Accessible SVGs

SVG images that are not used as buttons or images are hidden by default. As a fallback for screenreaders, the theme uses hidden ``<span class="SVGaltText">`` after the SVG element.

See the inline SVG technique mentioned in [Accessible SVGs](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/).

### Stylesheets

Parent theme styles are not used. The theme includes these stylesheets:

- style.min.css - minified child theme styles
- assets/css/inline.min.css - minified inline styles from advancement.clas.ufl.edu (unclear where these styles are used)

**Note: When updating any styles, be sure to search and update each breakpoint.**

The main stylesheet divides the styles into sections with media queries. Since these styles are redefined for each breakpoints instead of overriding previous styles, styles appear multiple times for each breakpoint.


### JavaScript

The JS files are minified and combined in the main JS file, script.min.js.

Custom JS file:

- theme.js

Modified versions of parent theme files:

- global.js
- jquery.scrollTo.js
- navigation.js
- skip-link-focus-fix.js

Included from the parent theme:

- html5.js

### Shortcodes

  - Example - `[ufl-icon name="asterisk" xclass="img-icon img-icon-alt"]`

### The Events Calendar
- Custom templates created in folders tribe-events and tribe.
- Shortcode created to display upcoming events
  - `[events-calendar category="featured" image="yes" eventtotal="10" excerpt="yes"]`
  - category will pull in that event category
  - image="yes" will display featured image
  - eventotal will set the amount of events to show
  - excerpt will display the excerpt

### IssueM
- This theme includes custom templates for IssueM. They are located in inc/issuem.
